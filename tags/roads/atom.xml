        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been working with BIM methodologies and the 3D world for some time now, mainly in BIM management for the Embalse Las Palmas project. Being on the management side, there is little time left to get hands-on and actually model, however, this year I have had time to get hands-on with ISTRAM, a 3D modeling software for linear works that greatly optimizes the design process and the generation of 3D models for linear works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
